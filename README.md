# Trafficlights Project

This project is designed to simulate a crossroads with four traffic lights. It's part of the LASAL Sigmatech suite and serves as a training exercise created by Klaas Post to familiarize with the Sigmatech stack. 

## Components
1. **PLC Project**: Opened in Lasal Class 2, this contains the logic controlling the traffic lights.
2. **HMI Project**: Opened in Lasal Screen, it provides a visual representation of the crossroads and traffic lights.

The entire setup is operational on an S-DIAS control system.
