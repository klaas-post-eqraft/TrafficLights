# 🚦 Trafficlights Project

This project is designed to simulate a crossroads with four traffic lights. It's built using the LASAL Sigmatech suite and serves as a training exercise created by Klaas Post to familiarize with the Sigmatech stack. 

## 📃 Features
- Four trafficlights turning from green to yellow to red and back.
- A traffic controller regulating traffic.
- A traffic simulation based on random number generation.

## 🥅 Goals
- Familiarize with Lasal programs, specifally Class 2 and Screen.
- Familiarize with basic project structure.
- Familiarize with naming conventions.
- Familiarize with coding style. 

## 🧩 Components
1. **PLC Project**: Opened in Lasal Class 2, this contains the logic controlling the traffic lights.
2. **HMI Project**: Opened in Lasal Screen, it provides a visual representation of the crossroads and traffic lights.

The entire setup is operational on an S-DIAS control system.

## ⏭️ Next steps
- Learn how and try to make use of pointers where applicable.
- Add controls to influence traffic density.
- Add HMI made in VISU instead of Screen.
- Add OPC server to serve data to external programs.
